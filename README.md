# ERSEM configuration and forcing data

Repository for ERSEM configurations and forcing data.

## 1D Water Column setups

### L4 from 2002 to 2020.

#### Data sources
- The salinity and temperature profiles were gernated via data from The Western Channel Observatory. The Western Channel Observatory is currently funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Centre Science Programme, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science, grant number NE/R015953/1.
- The meteorological forcing data is derived from hourly ERA5 data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS).
