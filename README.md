# ERSEM configuration and forcing data

Repository for ERSEM configurations and forcing data.

## 0D aquarium setups

### L4 from 2002 to 2020.

#### Data sources

- The meteorological forcing data comes from the ouput generated from the 1D water column configurations in this repository.
- Scripts have been adapted from the [FABM 0d GitHub repo](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/tree/master/testcases/0d)

## 1D Water Column setups

### L4 from 2002 to 2020.

#### Data sources
- The salinity and temperature profiles were gernated via data from The Western Channel Observatory. The Western Channel Observatory is currently funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council through its National Capability Long-term Single Centre Science Programme, Climate Linked Atlantic Sector Science, grant number NE/R015953/1.
- The meteorological forcing data is derived from hourly ERA5 data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS).

(2018): ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS). (Accessed on <09-02-2021>), 10.24381/cds.adbb2d47
- The tidal forcing data was generated using [FVCOM](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/fvcom/), as part of the Risks and Opportunities for Sustainable Aquaculture (ROSA) project, grant number BB/M026221/1.
